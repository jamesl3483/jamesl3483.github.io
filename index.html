      <!-- Intro -->
      <p class = "descript">Hi, I'm James. I'm currently a student at Santa Monica College
        where I am transfering as an electrical engineering major by Fall 2023. In Community College
        I got the time to think about my future and the step wanted to proceed through it.
        After almost 2 years, while finishing my classes towards engineering, I was able to participating in many clubs
        and programs which got me exposed to everything from business to technology. In the end, 
        I developed a passion for robotics. I was in the FIRST Robotics Compeition in high school and 
        continued in college by participating in multiple NASA sponsored programs such as 
        L'SPACE Mission Concept Academy and the NASA MINDS Competition.

        <!-- Hobbies -->
        When I'm not studying or participating in extracurriculars, you can find me cycling 
        to the beach or taking care of my garden in the backyard. Recently I have been 
        trying surfing, which is a fun, but cold experience. Otherwise, when I am too lazy to
        go outside, I watch a lot of YouTube or read a bunch of Light Novels/Manga. Sometimes,
        I get addicted to games like Genshin Impact, but that usually dies down after a few weeks.

            <p class = "descript">NASA MINDS is a design competition where students design 
              solution to problems on the Artemis Mission. Our group 
              chose decentralized swarm robotics and search algorithms. Due to budgeting concerns,
              We were combining Raspberry Pi, BrickPi, and Grove Sensors, which 
              made so many problems that I had to work out along with my team. In the end, 
              the project was stalled by constant hardware problems and we could only do basic 
              collision avoidance. However, I learned a lot about navigating through Linux and 
              using it to try mashing different systems and components together from having 
              to constantly fix the hardware problems

              and professors. It was an amazing experience where I learned
              a lot about Caltech's research, physics concepts, and 
              tools such as LaTex and Mathimatica. In addition, I was able to do a 
              small project that include vortex rings. Suprisingly it is super easy 
              to make a vortex ring.

             Mars is and the perfection needed to prevent a billion dollar

            My business that I started back in high school. As the Joker says,"if you are 
            good at something, never do it for free" (Heath Ledger). I had great responses
            when I tutored at my school's afterschool Peer Tutoring Program, so I decided
            to start an online profile as soon as I turned 18. Even though I wanted to 
            keep my rates cheap, there was too many people. At one point, I was 
            tutoring for 25 hours per week with 3-4 new requests per day. 
            As time went on, I increased my price to reduce the number of people
            instead of spending time trying to reject some of the parents.

            moments are some of the best feelings that I get.

            tedious work.
